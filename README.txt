This project was implemented for assignment 3 o Real Time Rendering and
3D games programming RMIT course and is based on Peggle.

Controls:
	-ESC/'q'/'Q': Exit program
	-'a'/'A': move projection direction to left
	-'d'/'D': move projection direction to right
	-'z'/'Z': move projection direction to left with more precision
	-'c'/'C': move projection direction to right with more precision
	-SPACE: launch ball
	-'m'/'M': toggle pegs moviments

How to play
	-Change the direction of the ball projection and launch it.
	-Each peg that the ball collides with will add 10 points in your score
	-Sometimes blue pegs can be randomly generated at the start of the game. If
	 your ball collides with one of them, it will start to move and to collide
	 with other pegs, increasing your changes to get points
	-Use m key to make the pegs move and increase the game difficulty
